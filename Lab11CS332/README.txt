Description --- This code takes the input of the user in the command line
                and uses the popen and pclose functions in C. With popen we are able
                to create a pipe between the calling program and the executed command

Purpose --- The reason behind this lab was to build on the knowledge of pipes that we learned
            in class and see the usages and power of this technique
